# Overview

This is a small CLI tool that aims to integrate with the Spotify API to display current artist, track name and album artwork in the terminal.

### Status

Current issues with safely accessing Spotify credentials mean that this only runs on my machine at the moment.

### Usage

```
npm install spotiterm
```

```
spotiterm
```
